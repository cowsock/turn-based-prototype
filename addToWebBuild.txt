<p>Move one of your pieces onto the opposing side's flag.</p>
<h1>Controls And Explanation</h1>
<p>Every turn, you can either (move or attack) <i>or</i> ajust the state of each of your units.</p>
<p>This is divided into two phases.</p>
<h2>Move Phase</h2>
<p>Click a unit to select it. Then click a highlighted space to move it there, or a highlighted enemy to attack that enemy.</p>
<p>You may move all of your units every turn if you wish.</p>
<p>To skip to the next phase, press the button in the upper right corner.</p>
<h2>Gear Change Phase</h2>
<p>Click any unit that <b>has not yet been moved</b> to select it, and press one of the 6 Gear Change buttons to adjust the unit.</p>
<p>Press the Skip Phase button if your are satisfied with the configuration of your units.</p>
<p>These options give units different movement or attacking options: (upward, on the same elevation, and downward)</p>
<p>The Move Up (Climbing a Rock Wall) and Move Down (Rappelling) states are needed to ascend to or descend from the highest elevation (mountains) </p>
<p>Attack options are more varied. The up attack option (bow and arrow) can target an enemy on a diagonal AND above the unit in elevation.
The down attack option (Boiling Oil) can target an enemy in any adjacent space (orthoganal and diagonal), provided that the enemy is lower in elevation.
Finally, the ground attack option can target an orthogonally adjacent space, and additionally includes a movement onto that space. </p>
