# turn-based-prototype
second game prototype - this one is a strategy game taking place in the mountains!

It doesn't really work all that well as a game, but I didn't have time to playtest it (or the willingness to subject people to such an unpolished concept!)

Even so, it's a demonstration of some super basic clickable UI stuff in Unity.
